# House-Prices-Project
This project aims to predict house prices in a given location using machine learning algorithms. The project uses a dataset of historical house sales data, along with information on the size, location, and other features of the houses, to train a regression model. The model is then used to make predictions on a test dataset of new houses for sale.
