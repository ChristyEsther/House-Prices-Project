Introduction: Our aim is to predict the prices of the houses in the locality of Armes, Iowa. We are provided with rich information about the houses like square feet, quality of the garage, neighborhood and other aspects of the houses. We are going to analyze the given dataset, do some performance analysis and find out the information behind the data. In the end we will be presenting the insights from the dataset, in the form of, factors that are directly affecting the sale price of the houses. 
Data Collection and Preprocessing: As the first step, we imported the libraries for the analysis of the dataset and reading the given csv file in the jupyter notebook. We made small evalutions of the dataset and found that the data has both numerical and categorical variables. So we created separate dataframe for the numerical and categorical variables respectively. It is noted that this data includes a lot of missing values, outliers, and other quality issues. 
Exploratory Data Analysis: Missing value treatment is an integral part of data analysis. Analyzing the missing values whether those are to be removed or imputed with necessary data values,  the missing values of the numerical variables ‘LotFrontage’ & ‘GaraYrBlt’ were imputed with their mean values respectively. It was surprising to see that all the rows in categorical variables had missing values which led to a lot of imputation. Calculating the percentage of missing values helped a ton much. The variables 'MiscFeature', 'Fence', 'PoolQC', 'FireplaceQu','Alley' had more than 40% of missing values, while the basement parameters 'BsmtCond', 'BsmtQual', 'BsmtExposure', 'BsmtFinType1', 'BsmtFinType2' had missing values in almost all the rows and hence those variables where decided to be dropped. The other variables like 'GarageCond', 'GarageQual', 'GarageFinish', 'GarageType', 'Electrical' were imputed with the most frequent value in the column (mode).  We got dataframe with categorical and numerical variables cleaned and missing values are treated. 
Feature Engineering and Selection: since the dataset given has more number of categorical variables, the variable indexes were encoded using one hot encoding method. The target variable ‘SalePrice’ had skewness more than 1 and the distribution is found to be right skewed distribution. This made us to use the log transform to make the data normalized. In order to find the significant variables from the given dataset, a correlation matrix was made and heat map generated. Its understandable that the lighter the colour shows strong correlation between variables. The variables ‘SalePrice’,’GarageCars’,’TotalBsmtArea’ showed correlations between them. A box plot was plotted and z scores were calculated to find that the target variable had many outlier values. But thinking in the context of the problem description, it is normal in any locality to have houses in all kinds of budget, extreme low and extreme high. Keeping this in mind the outliers were left to remain as it is. Correlation matrix between numerical variables was calculated which gave an insight that variables ‘OverallQual’,‘GrLivArea’ showed relationship with ‘SalePrice’. Here the “Sperman’s rank correlation coefficient” gave better resuts than ‘pearson’ and ‘kendall’.   This insight was plotted to express visually using a pair plot function. Count plot was used to perform the bivariate analysis between the categorical variables to find the significant variables. Finally the P values t-test and chi square test were performed and the values were calculated. The p values and chi square statistic obtained helped us to not to reject the null hypothesis.
Results and Interpretation: The entire analysis done on the given dataset helped us to conclude that the variables ‘OverallQual’, ‘GrLivArea’, ‘GarageCars’, ‘TotalBsmtSF’ are said to be highly correlated with or affecting the target variable ‘SalePrice’. Our null hypothesis that, every house buyer would generally look for overall building quality, total square feet area, size of living area, was right and we had no significant variable indicating for any alternate hypothesis. So, we can be sure that any stakeholder, buyer or seller of house at Ames,Iowa, can definitely look in to these variables and enhancing these aspects could definitely raise the chances of selling the property for a best price.
Conclusion: This project provided a valuable learning experience in applying my thoughts and knowledge of data science. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we gained insights into the trends and patterns within the dataset. Through this project, we learned the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and effectively communicating the findings. While there were some limitations and challenges encountered during the project, these were valuable learning opportunities. Overall, this project highlighted the power of data science in uncovering insights and informing decision-making.
